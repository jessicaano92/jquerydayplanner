# JQueryDayPlanner

## Description 

This day planner provides the current day from 9am to 5pm to save any plans inside the rows. It is displayed with grey, red, and green colors representing the past, present, and future of the planner. When something is typed into one of the rows it is saved into local storage so if the page is refreshed, the text from the user input will still remain in the planner. The planner is up-to-date with the current time and day.
